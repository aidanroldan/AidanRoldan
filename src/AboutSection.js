      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I would say that I am a multifaceted individual. With interests ranging from music production, to mechanical engineering I have widened my skill set with each new hobby that I have picked up. The main theme which encompasses all of my interests is technology. My passion is truly within tech, and there is nothing I love to do more than learn. As far as work and entrepreneurial experience, I am the kind of person who is comfortable taking matters into my own hands, using conceptual and critical thinking skills to complete tasks when minimal direction is given. The greatest example of this was one of my projects, LMS. A friend of mine had reached out to me saying that a client needed a solution for managing his cash advance business, and after further discussion we landed on the idea of a web application. You can read more about the project on my website, but with essentially no web development experience I was able to pull together a fully functional application for the client. I spent the majority of two weeks creating the application and although I was definitely not compensated by dollar amount, I was by something much more valuable than that. The knowledge I gained creating it, and the pride I felt creating it were something that money could never match.
