      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      The first two points I would make about myself are that I am passionate about cyber security and technology, and that I am detail-oriented with strong documentation skills. I feel that cybersecurity is one of the most important industries on earth right now, and I've got a bunch of personal experience dealing with cybersecurity.  From my girlfriend accidentally falling for phishing links and compromising her checking account to stumbling upon a massive data breach while casually scraping for customer data. My life experiences have taught me that confidentiality in the cyberspace is something which is overlooked by 90% of people. The next point made “Detail-oriented with strong documentation skills” is also something which is very important to me. One of my biggest grievances is miscommunication or not enough communication. Whenever I deliver my work or tool to another person, I always take my time to make sure every single detail is covered. It is an absolute shame when an entire process or experience is ruined over the smallest communication. 
      This is why I feel asking questions is so valuable, as you truly can never be too sure. With all this being said I truly hope you can consider me as a candidate. Not only do my interests and values align directly with your role, but I guarantee that I will outwork the other candidates. I am so eager to learn with you. I appreciate the time you took to read my cover letter..
